        Hello, I am Rohi, a 20 year old software engineer from the UK. 
        I work at Rolls Royce as an aerospace software engineer working closely with embedded systems and automation. 
        In my free time, I actively create full stack applications as you can find here!
        I am always honing and expanding my skills.
        I also study machine learning and the mathematics behind it in depth.
        My first ever big project was a projectile motion physics simulator that I built using Python
        in 2023 for my A-level coursework. Since then, I have been actively improving my skills.
